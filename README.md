🏆 Pheno.AI – AI-Powered Phenotyping for Efficient Crop Research
Pheno.AI was developed as part of the Tri-Continental Food Sustainability Innovation Challenge, a four-hour ideation competition where teams explored AI-driven startup ideas.

🌱 What is Pheno.AI?
Pheno.AI is an AI-driven phenotyping concept designed to enhance the efficiency of plant trait analysis in agricultural research. Traditional phenotyping—manually assessing plant characteristics—can be labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Our idea aimed to use AI and computer vision to:

Automate plant trait analysis using AI-powered image recognition.
Speed up phenotyping processes for researchers and agronomists.
Improve accuracy in detecting key plant characteristics.

💡 How We Developed the Idea
During the challenge, we utilized AI research tools like Perplexity Pro Search to explore key issues in agriculture and sustainability. Our research led us to phenotyping bottlenecks, and we saw an opportunity to apply AI to streamline the process.

We focused on:
🔍 Identifying current inefficiencies in phenotyping.
🤖 Exploring AI applications in plant science.
📊 Evaluating potential impacts on agricultural sustainability.

🏅 Competition & Recognition
Event: Tri-Continental Food Sustainability Innovation Challenge
Duration: 4 hours
Outcome: Runner-Up Prize ($250 per team)
Team Strength: AI-powered research and ideation

Although Pheno.AI remains an ideation project, our experience in applying AI to sustainability challenges was both insightful and rewarding!
